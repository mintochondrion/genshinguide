# Test

This guide was made to help players who are struggling to find out how to play Genshin at their various stages in the game whether they're beginners, intermediate players or end game players.

The information presented in most other guides can be bloated with numbers and unecessary information so this guide is to help both make end game easier to understand while also teaching you about the terms used to improve your knowledge on the character build system
